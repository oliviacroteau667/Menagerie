Assignment: 
P1 Menagerie

Description:
This project displays oscilating owl graphics of four different species and varying color. User interaction alters display.

Instructions:
Select one of the bottom "Refill..." buttons to display owls in the canvas either: 
- randomly
- in columns by species
- or in rows by color-accurate species

Select a radio button to interact with individual owls. The options are:
- extend wings by clicking an owl
- display horns by clicking a Black Barred owl
- generate a new owl by clicking anywhere on the canvas
- or replace an owl with a new, randomly generated owl by clicking it

Known Issue:
The owl oscillation is a bit more quick and extreme than I would have preferred.
